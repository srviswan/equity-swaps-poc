This is the date on which the additional shares are paid to the shareholders, or in the case of a reverse stock split, the number shares held by each shareholder is proportionally reduced.  Equity derivative transactions can be amended in firms' internal systems on such date.   In most markets, the listed stock price is reduced (or increased for a reverse stock split) to account for the split on the same date, but in some markets the price adjustment occurs on a later date.  In either case, equity derivative transactions should be amended on the date that the stocks are paid to the shareholders (or consolidated).",
