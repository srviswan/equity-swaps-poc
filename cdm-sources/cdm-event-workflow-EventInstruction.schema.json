As a result it is only associated with those primitives that can give way to such ambiguity, the quantityChange being one of those. An example of such is a reduction in the trade notional, which could be interpreted as either a trade correction (unless a maximum period of time post-event is specified as part of the qualification), a partial termination or a portfolio rebalancing in the case of an equity swap. On the other hand, an event such as the exercise is not expected to have an associated intent as there should not be ambiguity.",
