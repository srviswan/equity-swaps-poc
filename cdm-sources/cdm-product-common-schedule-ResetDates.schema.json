The financial business centers associated with determining the rate cut-off date are those specified in the reset dates adjustments. The rate cut-off number of days must be a negative integer (a value of zero would imply no rate cut off applies in which case the rateCutOffDaysOffset element should not be included). The relevant rate for each reset date in the period from, and including, a rate cut-off date to, but excluding, the next applicable period end date (or, in the case of the last calculation period, the termination date) will (solely for purposes of calculating the floating amount payable on the next applicable payment date) be deemed to be the relevant rate in effect on that rate cut-off date. For example, if rate cut-off days for a daily averaging deal is -2 business days, then the refix rate applied on (period end date - 2 days) will also be applied as the reset on (period end date - 1 day), i.e. the actual number of reset dates remains the same but from the rate cut-off date until the period end date, the same refix rate is applied. Note that in the case of several calculation periods contributing to a single payment, the rate cut-off is assumed only to apply to the final calculation period contributing to that payment. The day type associated with the offset must imply a business days offset.",
