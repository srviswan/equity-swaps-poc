The spread adjustment accounts for the difference between the old floating rate index relative to the new one. This spread amount is added to the existing spread to determine the new spread, which is applied from the specified effective date forward. In the case of the IBOR Fallback Rate Adjustments, the adjustment spread (also known as the Fallback Adjustment) accounts for two distinctions: i) the fact that the replacement Risk-Free Rate is an overnight rate while IBORs have term structures (e.g., 1, 3, 6-month LIBOR); and (ii) the historical spread differential between IBORs and their term equivalent Overnight Risk-Free Rate compounded rates.",
