  "description": " A class to specify all of the terms necessary to define and calculate a cash flow based on a fixed, a floating or an inflation index rate. The interest rate payout can be applied to interest rate swaps and FRA (which both have two associated interest rate payouts), credit default swaps (to represent the fee leg when subject to periodic payments) and equity swaps (to represent the funding leg). The associated globalKey denotes the ability to associate a hash value to the InterestRatePayout instantiations for the purpose of model cross-referencing, in support of functionality such as the event effect and the lineage.",
