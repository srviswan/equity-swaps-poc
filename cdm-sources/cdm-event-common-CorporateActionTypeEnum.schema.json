While the issue of bonus shares increases the total number of shares issued and owned, it does not change the value of the company. The value maps closely to the ISO code (BONU) defined as a bonus, scrip or capitalisation issue. Security holders receive additional assets free of payment from the issuer, in proportion to their holding."

The distinction between a merger and an acquisition has become increasingly blurred in various respects (particularly in terms of the ultimate economic outcome), although it has not completely disappeared in all situations. The value maps closely to the ISO code (MRGR) defined as an offer made to shareholders, normally by a third party, requesting them to sell (tender) or exchange their equities."

A reverse stock split or reverse split is a process by a company of issuing to each shareholder in that company a smaller number of new shares in proportion to that shareholder's original shares that are subsequently canceled. A reverse stock split is also called a stock merge. The reduction in the number of issued shares is accompanied by a proportional increase in the share price. The value maps closely to the ISO code (SPLR) defined as a decrease in a company's number of outstanding equities without any change in the shareholder's equity or the aggregate market value at the time of the split. Equity price and nominal value are increased accordingly."
