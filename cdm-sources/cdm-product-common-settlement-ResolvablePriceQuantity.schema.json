  "description": "Generic class to specify the quantity for different payout legs in a contractual product, when that quantity can vary across payout legs or across time. A resolvable quantity can always be resolved into a single quantity from the quantity notation which has a corresponding asset identifier. In addition to the base case, where quantity is directly specified as a number as part of the quantity notation, the other use cases are: (i) quantity based on some pre-defined schedule (eg amortising notional), (ii) quantity based on some pre-defined events (eg resetting cross-currency notional), or quantity set as reference to another quantity (eg equity notional as no. securities x price).",

      "description": "A product's quantity as a single, non-negative amount.  When specified as part of a product definition, this quantity attribute would not be set.  Instead it is specified on the quantity notation along with an asset identifier matching this payout's asset identifier.  This allows the quantity to be resolved for a payout leg, which can then be specified here for convenience during data processing.  There needs to be at least one resolvable quantity across payout legs of a product to define an anchor that other payout quantities can refer to.  This attribute is ignored when mapping existing FpML messages.",
