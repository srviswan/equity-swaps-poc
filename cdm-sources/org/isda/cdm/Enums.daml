-- | The enumerated values to specify the origin of a
--   corporate action transfer.
data CorporateActionTypeEnum 
  = CorporateActionTypeEnum_BonusIssue
  -- ^ Corporate action triggered by a bonus issue. A bonus
  --   issue or bonus share is a free share of stock given
  --   to current shareholders in a company, based upon the
  --   number of shares that the shareholder already owns.
  --   While the issue of bonus shares increases the total
  --   number of shares issued and owned, it does not change
  --   the value of the company. The value maps closely to
  --   the ISO code (BONU) defined as a bonus, scrip or
  --   capitalisation issue. Security holders receive
  --   additional assets free of payment from the issuer, in
  --   proportion to their holding.
  | CorporateActionTypeEnum_CashDividend
  -- ^ Corporate action triggered by the distribution of a
  --   cash dividend.
  | CorporateActionTypeEnum_ClassAction
  -- ^ Corporate action triggered by a Class Action. An
  --   action where an individual represents a group in a
  --   court claim. The judgment from the suit is for all
  --   the members of the group (class). The value maps
  --   closely to the ISO code (CLSA) defined as the
  --   situation where interested parties seek restitution
  --   for financial loss. The security holder may be
  --   offered the opportunity to join a class action
  --   proceeding and would need to respond with an
  --   instruction.
  | CorporateActionTypeEnum_Delisting
  -- ^ Corporate action triggered by the removal of a
  --   security from a stock exchange.
  | CorporateActionTypeEnum_EarlyRedemption
  -- ^ Corporate action triggered by an early redemption.
  --   The value maps closely to the ISO code (MCAL) defined
  --   as the redemption of an entire issue outstanding of
  --   securities, for example, bonds, preferred equity,
  --   funds, by the issuer or its agent, for example, asset
  --   manager, before final maturity.
  | CorporateActionTypeEnum_Liquidation
  -- ^ Corporate action triggered by a liquidation. When a
  --   business or firm is terminated or bankrupt, its
  --   assets are sold (liquidated) and the proceeds pay
  --   creditors. Any leftovers are distributed to
  --   shareholders. The value maps closely to the ISO code
  --   (LIQU) defined as a distribution of cash, assets or
  --   both. Debt may be paid in order of priority based on
  --   preferred claims to assets specified by the security.
  | CorporateActionTypeEnum_Merger
  -- ^ Corporate action triggered by a merger. Mergers and
  --   acquisitions (abbreviated M&amp;A) is an aspect of
  --   corporate strategy, corporate finance and management
  --   dealing with the buying, selling, dividing and
  --   combining of different companies and similar entities
  --   that can help an enterprise grow rapidly in its
  --   sector or location of origin, or a new field or new
  --   location, without creating a subsidiary, other child
  --   entity or using a joint venture. The distinction
  --   between a merger and an acquisition has become
  --   increasingly blurred in various respects
  --   (particularly in terms of the ultimate economic
  --   outcome), although it has not completely disappeared
  --   in all situations. The value maps closely to the ISO
  --   code (MRGR) defined as an offer made to shareholders,
  --   normally by a third party, requesting them to sell
  --   (tender) or exchange their equities.
  | CorporateActionTypeEnum_ReverseStockSplit
  -- ^ Corporate action triggered by a reverse split. A
  --   reverse stock split or reverse split is a process by
  --   a company of issuing to each shareholder in that
  --   company a smaller number of new shares in proportion
  --   to that shareholder&#39;s original shares that are
  --   subsequently canceled. A reverse stock split is also
  --   called a stock merge. The reduction in the number of
  --   issued shares is accompanied by a proportional
  --   increase in the share price. The value maps closely
  --   to the ISO code (SPLR) defined as a decrease in a
  --   company&#39;s number of outstanding equities without
  --   any change in the shareholder&#39;s equity or the
  --   aggregate market value at the time of the split.
  --   Equity price and nominal value are increased
  --   accordingly.
  | CorporateActionTypeEnum_RightsIssue
  -- ^ Corporate action triggered by an issuance to
  --   shareholders of rights to purchase additional shares
  --   at a discount.
  | CorporateActionTypeEnum_SpinOff
  -- ^ Corporate action triggered by a spin Off. A spin-out,
  --   also known as a spin-off or a starburst, refers to a
  --   type of corporate action where a company splits off
  --   sections of itself as a separate business. The value
  --   maps closely to the ISO code (SOFF) defined as a a
  --   distribution of subsidiary stock to the shareholders
  --   of the parent company without a surrender of shares.
  --   Spin-off represents a form of divestiture usually
  --   resulting in an independent company or in an existing
  --   company. For example, demerger, distribution,
  --   unbundling.
  | CorporateActionTypeEnum_StockDividend
  -- ^ Corporate action triggered by the distribution of a
  --   stock dividend.
  | CorporateActionTypeEnum_StockIdentifierChange
  -- ^ Corporate action triggered by a change in the code
  --   used to trade the security.
  | CorporateActionTypeEnum_StockNameChange
  -- ^ Corporate action triggered by a change in the name
  --   used to trade the security.
  | CorporateActionTypeEnum_StockReclassification
  -- ^ Corporate action triggered by a Stock
  --   Reclassification.
  | CorporateActionTypeEnum_StockSplit
  -- ^ Corporate action triggered by a stock split. A stock
  --   split or stock divide increases the number of shares
  --   in a public company. The price is adjusted such that
  --   the before and after market capitalization of the
  --   company remains the same and dilutiondoes not occur.
  --   The value maps closely to the ISO code (SPLF) defined
  --   as a distribution of subsidiary stock to the
  --   shareholders of the parent company without a
  --   surrender of shares.
  | CorporateActionTypeEnum_Takeover
  -- ^ Corporate action triggered by a takeover. A takeover
  --   is the purchase of onecompany (the target) by another
  --   (the acquirer, or bidder). The value maps to the ISO
  --   code (TEND) but is finer grained than TEND which
  --   emcompasses Tender/Acquisition/Takeover/Purchase
  --   Offer/Buyback. ISO defines the TEND code as an offer
  --   made to shareholders, normally by a third party,
  --   requesting them to sell (tender) or exchange their
  --   equities.
