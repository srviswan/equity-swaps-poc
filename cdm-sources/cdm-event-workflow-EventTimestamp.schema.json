At some future point, one possible baseline could be developed from the review of the set of timestamps specified across regulatory regimes and regulations (incl. regulations such as high frequency trading). Also, the integration with a further set of implementations and the specification of business workflows such as clearing as part of the CDM development should help confirm the implementation approach in this respect.",
